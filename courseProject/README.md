```powershell
docker exec {node-name} mkdir -p /tmp/kube
```

2. Clone the repository at a tagged release:

```powershell
git clone --branch 2.9 --depth 1 https://github.com/JonatanSchmidlechner/-KubernetesSubmissions.git
```

```powershell
cd .\-KubernetesSubmissions\courseProject
```

4. Apply all manifests at once:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```
