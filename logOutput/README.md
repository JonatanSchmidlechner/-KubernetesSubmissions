# Log output app

## Instructions to deploy the app

1. Make sure your cluster is running.
2. Create the deployment by applying the deployment.yaml file from internet:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonatanSchmidlechner/-KubernetesSubmissions/refs/heads/main/logOutput/manifests/deployment.yaml
```
3. (Optional) View logs to see the random strings generated by the app:
```powershell
kubectl logs -f deployment/logoutput-dep
```
